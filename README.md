## My Introduction to GitHub Workflow

It may or may not come as a shock to the community, but I am a student at Clemson University pursuing my M.S. in Computer Engineering... and I don't exactly know how to use GitHub.

From my understanding, GitHub provides substantial value in terms of code management, especially when working on team projects with multiple developers. I can also see how GitHub allows code to be more portable and accessible from different machines. Just write, upload, and repeat.

I'm joining a project with a couple of my fellow Grad Students, and the project is stored on GitHub. I have some previous experience with the platform via my Capstone Project at the University of South Carolina. A couple of things about that statement: 1) I recognize the irony of my academic journey -- graduating from one university and continuing my education with their rival. 2) I am not overly excited to discuss that project, but I will if I must.

From my current point of view, I see this is as an opportunity to do better than I have done before. In order for me to make significant contributions to a group project, I think I should have some knowledge about _how_ to make contributions to a group project. That's what prompted me to the Get Started with GitHub. After briefly scanning some introductory documentation, I think I'd like to see how many green squares I can get.

Thank you for your patience and consideration during this educational process. I'm no expert, but who knows what the future holds.
